## ðŸ›  Install

Windows, MacOs or Linux: It's a pure HTML, CSS and JS project, just open
the project with some code editor and open through a simple server
like VsCode's LiveServer.

## ðŸ’» Dev env setup

As it is a website made with native technologies supported by browsers,
No configuration is required to run the project. Just open it
in a code editor and a simple server. I recommend using VSCode and
install the "Live Server" extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to create a local server and have the reloading functionality when saving the project.
